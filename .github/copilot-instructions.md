- refer to PLAN.md for the overall summary of the project.

## Documentation Standards

1. **Root-level main markdown**: Any functional, architectural, or code updates MUST update relevant subdirectory documentation after work completion.

2. **Every folder MUST have a README.md with**:
   - Concise architecture description (≤3 lines)
   - List of each file with: name, status, and function
   - Header declaration: "Once my folder has changes, please update me."

3. **Every file MUST have header comments**:
   - **Input**: External dependencies (what this file needs)
   - **Output**: What it provides externally (what others use from this)
   - **Pos**: Role/position in the local system architecture
   - Reminder: "Once I am updated, update my header comments and folder's md."

- update PLAN.md after any progress.
